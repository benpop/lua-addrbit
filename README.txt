Bitwise operations on 64-bit integers via void pointer.

Analogous to bit32 library in Lua 5.2, and supports the same operations.
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.7

Very likely needs C99 for an assured 64-bit integral type.  This is the default C version in the Makefile.

You need a 64-bit machine and OS for this to work.

Supports Lua 5.1 and 5.2.
